# Colorado Post-Secondary Outcomes Data Explorer

## Introduction

One important factor that goes into many people's decisions when choosing a major or field of study is how much they will make after they graduate. There are many ways to try to picture how one's future earnings will look like- this app in particular uses data collected by the US Census Bureau to help users understand how much graduates from Colorado schools have made 1, 5, and 10 years after graduation. The goal for this app is to help the user make more informed decisions about their future path by exploring this data set.
